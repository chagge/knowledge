# clab knowledge

> To know, is to know that you know nothing. That is the meaning of true knowledge.

This repository is meant to share knowledge (well, and pieces of information too) which is not suitable for sharing elsewhere, among members of clab. Feel free to create a new file if need be, but make sure to link to it from this one for easy access.
