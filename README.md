# clab knowledge

> to know, is to know that you know nothing. that is the meaning of true knowledge. -- socrates

this repository is meant to share knowledge (well, and pieces of information too) which is not suitable for sharing elsewhere, among members of clab. Feel free to create a new file if need be, but make sure to link to it from this one for easy access. [GFL guidelines]  (https://github.com/brendano/gfl_syntax/blob/master/guidelines/guidelines.md) is a good example of a nicely written .md file, just in case you're not familiar with the Markdown script.

## computational resources

### allegro
* software packages of general interest should be installed at ```allegro:/opt/tools``` and a modulefile (learn more about Environment Modules [here] (http://modules.sourceforge.net/)) should be added at ```allegro:/opt/modulefiles``` so that other people can find it by executing ```module avail```
* corpora can be found at ```allegro:/usr1/corpora```, ```allegro:/cab1/corpora```, ```allegro:/mal1/corpora```, or ```allegro:/mal2/corpora```
