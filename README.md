# clab knowledge

> to know, is to know that you know nothing. that is the meaning of true knowledge. -- socrates

this repository is meant to share knowledge (well, and pieces of information too) which is not suitable for sharing elsewhere, among members of clab. Feel free to create a new file if need be, but make sure to link to it from this one for easy access. [GFL guidelines]  (https://github.com/brendano/gfl_syntax/blob/master/guidelines/guidelines.md) is a good example of a nicely written .md file, just in case you're not familiar with the Markdown script.
